            <h3>Blog Post One</h3>
            <small>Posted by Levi on July 10</small>
            <p>Exciting first day, went through course of HTML and learned the basics. HTML honestly isn't as bad as I thought, since finally understanding it's purpose helps my understanding of how to use it. 
                It does seem a bit weird to see a bare website, but I'm assuming CSS will quickly brighten everything up. Either way, I can't wait to see what else I can do. Thankfully, using Tkinter in the past 
                makes most of the layouts look familiar, but still a bit of a challenge to learn. Can't wait to continue through this endeavor, but I'm excited as always! One piece of advice I have is to ensure 
                that anyone who wishes to do this has a plan before rushing straight into something.</p>
